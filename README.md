### 1. Information We Collect
We do not collect or transmit any personal information. All data entered into the app—such as field names, acreage, chemical formulas, and spray history—is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or third parties. However, to enable mapping features, the app requests access to your device’s location. This information is used only within the app to allow you to place and view field locations on a map. Location data is not stored, tracked, or shared.

### 2. Use of Location Services
When you use features that rely on maps, the app may ask for permission to access your location. This is used to:
    - Display your current position on the map
    - Help you place or view your fields geographically
    - Your location is processed in real-time on your device and is not stored or sent to any server.

### 4. Field and Spray Data
Any data you enter (e.g., field details, chemical mix formulas, spray jobs) is used only to provide the core functionality of the app. This data is stored on your device and is under your control.

### 5. Analytics & Tracking
We do not use any third-party analytics tools, advertising networks, or tracking mechanisms.

### 6. Internet Connectivity
The app may require an internet connection to:
    - Load and display Apple Maps tiles
    - Access location services provided by Apple
    - However, all your input data (chemical formulas, fields, spray records) is stored locally on your device, and is never uploaded to the internet or shared with us.

### 7. Your Control and Responsibility
Because all data is stored locally, you are responsible for managing your device’s backups. If you delete the app or reset your device, your data may be lost unless backed up using iCloud or another method.
